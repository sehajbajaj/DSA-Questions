### DFS
​
- For the trees to be identical, the value of nodes of both trees should be same along with their left and right children's values.
- Base case -> if both the nodes are null, they are identical so return true.
- Edge case -> any one of the node is null, the trees are not identical so return false.
​
### TC - O(N) and SC - O(N)
